# TinyGallery Backend CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the TinyGallery Backend project.

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying the TinyGallery Backend. It ensures that all changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Code Checkout

- The pipeline starts by checking out the latest code from the main branch of our Git repository.

### 2. Environment Setup

- Set up a Python virtual environment.
- Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

### 3. Linting

- Run `flake8` to check for any code style issues.
- Ensure all Python files conform to PEP 8 standards.

### 4. Unit Testing

- Run all unit tests using `pytest`.
- Generate a test coverage report.

### 5. Integration Testing

- Set up a test database.
- Run integration tests that interact with the database and API endpoints.

### 6. Security Scan

- Perform a security scan using a tool like `bandit` to identify any potential security vulnerabilities.

### 7. Build

- If all previous stages pass, create a Docker image of the application.

### 8. Push to Registry

- Push the Docker image to our container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).

### 9. Deployment

- For the main branch:
  - Deploy to the staging environment.
  - Run smoke tests to ensure basic functionality.
  - If smoke tests pass, deploy to production.
- For feature branches:
  - Deploy to a temporary environment for review.

### 10. Post-Deployment Tests

- Run a suite of end-to-end tests on the deployed application.
- Monitor application performance and error rates.

## Continuous Monitoring

- Set up alerts for any unusual activity or errors in the production environment.
- Regularly review logs and performance metrics.

## Rollback Procedure

In case of a failed deployment or critical issues in production:

1. Immediately revert to the last known good version.
2. Investigate the cause of the failure.
3. Fix the issue in a separate branch.
4. Re-run the entire pipeline before attempting to deploy again.

## Manual Approvals

- Deployment to production requires manual approval from a team lead or senior developer.

## Pipeline Configuration

Our pipeline is configured using [CI/CD tool name, e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions]. The configuration file can be found at [location of configuration file].

## Best Practices

- Always write and update tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Regularly update dependencies and address any security vulnerabilities.
- Review and optimize the pipeline regularly for better performance and reliability.

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline ensures that our TinyGallery Backend is thoroughly tested and safely deployed. It helps maintain high code quality and reduces the risk of introducing bugs into production.
